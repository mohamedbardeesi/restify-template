# 001 Basic RESTify Template

This directory contains a basic template based on the popular [RESTIfy for NodeJS](http://www.restify.com).  The template is used in conjunction with the tutorials posted at [YourAPIExpert.com](http://www.yourapiexpert.com) and should be considered suitable for learning and not production use.

## Included In This Template

As a basic template it shows how to establish a basic HTTP server capable of serving APIs and demonstrates how to establish and handle various routes in a simple 'Hello World' example.

So that students can begin learning essential disciplines early this template also incorporates a number of additional functionalities such as:

* The separation of routes in to additional controller files.
* The use of separate configuration files rather than relying on in-app configuration.
* The early adoption of suitable logging mechanisms rather than relying on console.logging

## How To Use This Template

Check out the repository and run 'npm install'.  Afterwards the server can be started with 'node server.js' and monitored from the console.
