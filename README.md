# YourAPIExpert RESTify Templates

This repository contains a templates based on the popular [RESTIfy for NodeJS](http://www.restify.com).  These templates are used in conjunction with the tutorials posted at [YourAPIExpert.com](http://www.yourapiexpert.com) and sequentially build upon knowledge and confidence.  

Although most templates are designed to demonstrate particular functions they may be suitable as a base for your application and purpose.

The later templates include mechanisms for security and throttling and may be suitable for production use.
